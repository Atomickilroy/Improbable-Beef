## Summary: 

 This project was a display of how to create and engaging and dynamic dashboard with our 'friend' Roza. By using web visualizations and Github Pages. With Github Pages we were able to build a web page that allows a user to interact with our .json file without having to run their own local serve. 
 Additionally this dashboarded allowed for a quick way for one of Rozas volunteers to select their anonymized ID from the dropdown menu in the browser to display information about their results.
